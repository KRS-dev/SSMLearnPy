    "These computations are described in the manuscript [3]. We take velocity fields generated by Channelflow [4] and build reduced order models which are able to capture the transition between dynamically relevant coherent states, with parametric dependance on the Reynolds number. We note that the results presented in the manuscript were obtained by processing the full velocity fields, which had resolution $(N_x, N_y, N_z) = (32, 35, 32)$.\n",

    "In this notebook, simply to avoid having to upload large volumes of data, we use a compressed representation of the full flow fields by taking the projection to the first 20 PCA modes. Note that, due to the choice of our coordinates, this compression has no influence on the dynamical modeling. The full data is available from the authors upon request. \n",

    "is a stable fixed point in this flow. The lower and upper branch fixed points appear in a saddle-node bifurcation at $\\text{Re}=134.50$. The lower branch is an unstable fixed point, while the upper branch is stable. In this notebook, we fix $\\text{Re} = 135$, and conclude that a reduced-order model can be obtained by restricting the flow to a two-dimensional spectral submanifold (SSM) [5]. Indeed, there exists a unique, robust smoothest invariant manifold tangent to the least stable subspace of the stable fixed point. We choose to parametrize this manifold using the square root of the energy input rate $J = \\sqrt{|I|}$ and that of the energy dissipation rate $K= \\sqrt{|D|}$, where $I$ and $D$ are defined as\n",
